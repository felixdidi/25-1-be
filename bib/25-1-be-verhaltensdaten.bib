  abstract = {Digital trace data form a rich, growing source of data for social sciences and humanities. Data donation offers an innovative and ethical approach to collect these digital trace data. In data donation studies, participants request a copy of the digital trace data a data controller (e.g., large digital social media or video platforms) collected about them. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation obliges platforms to provide such a copy. Next, the participant can choose to share (part of) this data copy with the researcher. This way, the researcher can obtain the digital trace data of interest with active consent of the participant. Setting up a data donation study involves several steps and considerations. If executed poorly, these steps might threaten a study’s quality. In this paper, we introduce a workflow for setting up a robust data donation study. This workflow is based on error sources identified in the Total Error Framework for data donation by Boeschoten et al. (2022a) as well as on experiences in earlier data donation studies by the authors. The workflow is discussed in detail and linked to challenges and considerations for each step. We aim to provide a starting point with guidelines for researchers seeking to set up and conduct a data donation study.},

  abstract = {Every person who sends email, text messages, tweets, or simply surfs the Web leaves a digital trace. Researchers are just starting to comprehend the possibilities of “big data” for creating a new picture of social behavior. The potential for innovative work on social and cultural topics far outstrips current data collection and analysis techniques for a variety of reasons, including researchers' lack of access to corporate data sets, technical skills, and analytical lenses. This article draws a distinction between “horizontal” trace data sets that aggregate a specific type of trace, such as all tweets with a certain hashtag, and “vertical” trace data sets, which are organized around research participants. Although both types of data are observations of real-world digital behavior, they each have distinct advantages and disadvantages for the researcher. Combining these two forms of data provides a richer picture of online activity, and adding other types of data such as interviews, surveys, and experiments can contextualize online activity within broader social processes.},

  abstract = {While survey research has been at the heart of social science for decades and social scientific research with digital trace data has been growing rapidly in the last few years, until now, there are relatively few studies that combine these two data types. This may be surprising given the potential of linking surveys and digital trace data, but at the same time, it is important to note that the collection and analysis of such linked data are challenging in several regards. The three key issues are: (1) data linking including informed consent for individual-level studies, (2) methodological and ethical issues impeding the scientific (re)analysis of linked survey and digital trace data sets, and (3) developing conceptual and theoretical frameworks tailored toward the multidimensionality of such data. This special issue addresses these challenges by presenting cutting-edge methodological work on how to best collect and analyze linked data as well as studies that have successfully combined survey data and digital trace data to find innovative answers to relevant social scientific questions.},
