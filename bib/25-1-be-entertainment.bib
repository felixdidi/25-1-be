  abstract = {This chapter takes a process view of the entertainment experience by discussing how one can define an experience as a               process               and how media experience processes contribute to entertainment. Against the background of general theories about time, process, and measurement, an entertainment process is conceptualized as a set of characteristic sequences of intelligibly connected events based on specific rules and parameters of time. These characteristic events could be seen as entertainment experiences themselves, but they also contribute to a final evaluation after media exposure. Although most communication scholars concur that entertainment has processual aspects and therefore measure responses or experiences during exposure, a perspective on the process as a whole (i.e., its time dependency and consequences) is rarely investigated. Therefore, the process perspective is analyzed using a number of entertainment theories. This research posits that entertainment theories as well as the measurement of entertainment processes could benefit from a more detailed exposition about the theoretical assumptions on the shape of a process.},

While past research related self-control almost exclusively to whether individuals engage in media use, it might be equally relevant for the disengagement from media use. Testing core assumptions of the Appraisal of Media Use, Self-Control, and Entertainment (AMUSE) model, the present study investigates the situational interplay of self-control and affective appraisals in predicting disengagement from Netflix use. Preregistered hypotheses were tested based on an event-contingent experience sampling design, in which 205 adult Netflix users in the Netherlands and Germany were tracked and surveyed for two weeks. Results demonstrate that disengagement is contingent upon enjoyment and appreciation and that enjoyment, in turn, can be “spoiled” by feeling guilty. Self-control influenced goal conflict and enjoyment throughout the reception process. We discuss opportunities for modeling disengagement from media use with situational research approaches.},

In contrast to the primarily negative connotation of escapism found in prior research, we propose that escapist entertainment use may be a functional coping strategy in some situations and may thus have beneficial effects on the well-being of media users. To develop and illustrate our perspective, we turn to binge-watching as a prominent example of escapist entertainment use. We show exemplarily how escapist binge-watching can contribute to recovery from stress and close our chapter with reflections on how to further develop escapism research.},

The current contribution elaborates on the causes and manifestations of meaningfulness and argues that resonances between entertainment content (characters, situations, decisions, or metaphors) and audience members’ biographic memories—particular recollections of critical life incidents or life crisis—generate experiences of meaning. Such biographic resonance is suggested to cause eudaimonic entertainment, specifically mixed-affect experiences that combine negative feelings associated with the audience member’s past or current life crisis with hope and other-praising emotions that emerge from the inspiration and advice obtained from the entertainment message. This chapter formalizes biographic resonance theory as postulated interaction of message attributes and audience members’ biographies and develop programmatic perspectives on theory extensions and testing as well as implications for entertainment effects on human well-being at the population level.},

Hedonic responses are thought to result from relatively effortless reception of non-challenging (or “light”) media fare. In contrast, eudaimonic entertainment experiences are theorized to depend on cognitively or affectively challenging content (e.g., tragedies) and effortful reflection. The present work builds on the meaning-as-information framework and the meaning-making model to suggest a conceptual alternative. We argue that audience members can have eudaimonic experiences—particularly, meaningful experiences—without intense challenges and cognitive labor by detecting meaning in messages that affirm (or “celebrate”) their core values. An online experiment (NStudy1\,=\,275) and a pre-registered replication (NStudy2\,=\,253) with viewers of short video clips provided substantial support for this proposition. Our discussion highlights that the analytical differentiation of low-effort hedonic and high-effort eudaimonic modes of entertainment needs revision.},

Though a growing body of research demonstrates beneficial short-term effects of entertainment use on recovery and stress coping, a test of longitudinal effects on positive adaptation to adversity is largely missing. The present study aims at providing a salutogenic perspective on the mental health effects of entertainment use by addressing the longitudinal relationship between hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment preferences (i.e., the individual entertainment diet) and three indicators of psychological resilience: hope, meaning in life, and trait resilience. Pre-registered hypotheses and research questions were tested based on data from a longitudinal panel study with two waves over a 6-month time period and               N               = 2,561 participants from Germany. The findings demonstrate that only meaning in life at T2 was significantly albeit weakly predicted by eudaimonic entertainment preferences at T1, providing limited support for prospective effects of entertainment use on resilience. In contrast, the data demonstrate selective exposure effects of hope and trait resilience at T1 on eudaimonic and hedonic entertainment preferences at T2. All three resilience indicators were significant predictors of mental health and psychological wellbeing. We discuss implications of our findings for future research on salutary mental health effects of narratives and media entertainment.},

On the other, researchers have highlighted the potential of entertainment in terms of audience interest, cognitive accessibility, and public outreach. A literature overview shows theoretical and empirical support for both sides of the controversy about the (dys)functionality of entertainment in political communication. Therefore, in an attempt to reconcile the divergent findings, the chapter presents an extended dual-process model of entertainment effects on political information processing and engagement. This framework offers substantial extensions to existing dual-process models of entertainment by conceptualizing the effects of entertainment on different forms of political engagement that have not been incorporated so far.},

Recent approaches in entertainment research have extended the scope from hedonic gratifications (fun, suspense) to meaningful and thought-provoking entertainment experiences (appreciation). The present research examines the cross-national measurement validity of these theoretical constructs by testing the factorial structure of the German version of the Appreciation, Fun, and Suspense scales developed by Oliver and Bartsch (2010) . Measurement invariance of the scales across US-American ( N = 262) and German ( N = 274) samples is examined by reanalyzing data sets from two published studies. Findings support the theoretically assumed three-factorial model of the German scale and partial scalar invariance across samples. In addition, exploratory analyses of a third data set ( N = 200) revealed that an alternative wording for an item of the Suspense scale may be superior.},

  abstract = {The narrative enjoyment and appreciation rationale (NEAR) builds on dual-process logic to distinguish these two forms of audience response to media entertainment shaped by either an intuitive or deliberative processing system. Three message features are critical in determining how these systems govern response: (1) the absence or presence of intuition conflict in the narrative, (2) the extent to which different intuitions are made salient (i.e., emphasized in the plot), and (3) the satisfaction/thwarting of those salient intuitions, where satisfaction refers to reward for acts that conform to intuitions, and thwarting refers to the inverse of this. When               all               salient intuitive needs are satisfied by entertainment experience, positive affect produced by intuitive processes is labeled               enjoyment               . By comparison, when the entertainment experience satisfies               the most salient               intuitive needs, but               not all salient               intuitive needs, positive affect produced by deliberative processing is labeled               appreciation               .},

  abstract = {This chapter offers some historical and conceptual orientation to readers of the Oxford Handbook of Entertainment Theory. Departing from a brief review of ancient roots and twentieth-century pioneer works, we elaborate on the state and challenges of contemporary entertainment theory and research. This includes the need to develop a more explicit understanding of interrelationships among similar terms and concepts (e.g., “presence” and “transportation”), the need to reflect more explicitly on epistemological foundations of entertainment theories (e.g., neobehaviorism), and the need to reach back to past, even historical reasoning in communication that may be just as informative as the consideration of recent theoretical innovations from neighboring fields such as social psychology. Finally, we offer some reflections on programmatic perspectives for future entertainment theory, which should try to harmonize views from the social sciences and critical thinking, span cultural differences in entertainment processes, and keep track of the rapid technological progress of entertainment media.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter aims to differentiate between two kinds of media use experiences that in the past twenty some years have uniformly been labeled entertainment experiences. In the background of four identified fundamental assumptions in entertainment theory (entertainment as reception phenomenon, disparity between what media users want and what they should want, entertainment between approaching and avoiding affective states, entertainment as self-transcendence) media experiences are dichotomized between those that serve users’ hedonic motivations, needs, and interests and others, more fundamental experiences of resonance (which in the recent past have often been labeled eudaimonic) that connect users to the content of a media narrative and ultimately changes them. The argument is made here for communication scholars and media psychologists to refer to entertainment experiences only in the first case in order to be less vague and ambiguous in explicating entertainment theory.},

  abstract = {Why do we entertain ourselves with media narratives? Although the most recent answer to this question (Oliver et al., 2018) provides a far more complex understanding of entertainment use compared to earlier theorizing, it still leaves important questions unanswered. Our primary ambition here is to introduce a new theoretical perspective that may be used to explain entertainment experiences on the basis of the sociological theory of resonance (Rosa, 2018). This theory focusses on genuine, ‘vibrant’ connections individuals can have with others and with the world. Our thesis is that this form of connection resembles what in more recent theories of entertainment is labelled eudaimonic experiences. But while these eudaimonic experiences are often seen as complementing hedonic ones, we propose to categorically distinguish between the two with only regarding the hedonic dimension as entertaining and the eudaimonic one as ‘resonant’ relationship. From this point of view, media narratives are selected either for their impact on a user’s affective states or for their potential to provide a user with a resonant connection. This conceptualization not only allows to answer some of the still open questions in entertainment theory but to also include the social and historical context of entertainment use.},
